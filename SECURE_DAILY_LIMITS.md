# 🔒 Secure Daily Limits System

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The previous daily limits system had a critical security flaw: **daily limits were stored in user sessions**, which could be easily manipulated or bypassed by:

1. **Session Deletion** - Users could delete their session and get 4 more scrapings
2. **Logout/Login** - Logging out would reset daily limits to 0
3. **Session Manipulation** - Users could modify session data to reset limits
4. **No Persistence** - Limits weren't tied to actual user identity

## ✅ **Solution: Access Code-Based Daily Limits**

Daily limits are now stored in **`codes.json`** (the access codes file) instead of `sessions.json`, making them:

- **🔒 Secure** - Cannot be manipulated by users
- **📈 Persistent** - Survive session deletion and logout
- **🆔 Identity-Based** - Tied to access codes, not WhatsApp sessions
- **🔄 Consistent** - Same limits regardless of how many times user logs in/out

## 🏗️ **New Architecture**

### **Before (Insecure)**
```
sessions.json → user session → dailyScraping object
     ↓
❌ Deleted when session deleted
❌ Reset on logout
❌ Easy to manipulate
```

### **After (Secure)**
```
codes.json → access code → dailyScraping object
     ↓
✅ Persists through session changes
✅ Cannot be deleted by users
✅ Admin-controlled only
```

## 📁 **File Structure**

### **`codes.json` (Access Codes)**
```json
{
  "user1": {
    "apiKeys": { ... },
    "createdAt": "2025-08-18T02:34:23.747Z",
    "meta": { ... },
    "dailyScraping": {
      "date": "Tue Aug 26 2025",
      "count": 2,
      "lastReset": "2025-08-26T02:09:02.428Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### **`sessions.json` (User Sessions)**
```json
{
  "212691708186@s.whatsapp.net": {
    "code": "user1",
    "apiKeys": { ... },
    "language": "en",
    "prefs": { ... }
    // ❌ No more dailyScraping object
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **Implementation Changes**

### **1. File Constants**
```javascript
// Added ACCESS_CODES_FILE constant
const ACCESS_CODES_FILE = path.join(__dirname, 'codes.json');
```

### **2. `checkDailyScrapingLimit()` Function**
- **Before**: Read limits from `session.dailyScraping`
- **After**: Read limits from `accessCodes[userCode].dailyScraping`
- **Benefit**: Limits persist even if session is deleted

### **3. `incrementDailyScrapingCount()` Function**
- **Before**: Update `session.dailyScraping.count`
- **After**: Update `accessCodes[userCode].dailyScraping.count`
- **Benefit**: Counts saved to permanent access codes file

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **1. User Authentication**
```
User sends: CODE: user1
Bot creates: session.code = "user1"
```

### **2. Daily Limit Check**
```
Bot checks: accessCodes["user1"].dailyScraping.count
Result: 2/4 remaining
```

### **3. Scraping Start**
```
Bot increments: accessCodes["user1"].dailyScraping.count += 1
Bot saves: codes.json (permanent storage)
```

### **4. Session Deletion/Logout**
```
User deletes session → ❌ Daily limits remain intact
User logs out → ❌ Daily limits remain intact
User creates new session → ✅ Same daily limits apply
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Verification**

### **Test Scenario: Session Deletion**
1. User has 2/4 scrapings remaining
2. User deletes session (logout)
3. User creates new session with same code
4. **Result**: Still 2/4 remaining ✅

### **Test Scenario: Multiple Sessions**
1. User has 2/4 scrapings remaining
2. User logs in from different device
3. **Result**: Same 2/4 remaining ✅

### **Test Scenario: Daily Reset**
1. User has 4/4 scrapings used
2. Clock passes midnight
3. **Result**: Automatically resets to 0/4 ✅

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **Security**
- ✅ **No manipulation** - Users cannot reset their limits
- ✅ **Admin control** - Only admins can modify access codes
- ✅ **Persistent** - Limits survive all session changes

### **Reliability**
- ✅ **Consistent** - Same limits across all devices/sessions
- ✅ **Accurate** - Real-time count tracking
- ✅ **Resilient** - Survives crashes and restarts

### **User Experience**
- ✅ **Transparent** - STATUS command shows accurate limits
- ✅ **Fair** - All users get exactly 4 scrapings per day
- ✅ **Predictable** - Limits reset at midnight, not on logout

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **STATUS Command**
```
📊 Your Scraping Status

📊 Daily Scraping Status: 2/4 remaining
⏰ Resets: Tomorrow at midnight
```

### **Daily Limit Reached**
```
❌ Daily Scraping Limit Reached

You have used all 4 scraping jobs for today.
Please come back tomorrow for fresh limits.

📊 Daily Scraping Status: 0/4 remaining
⏰ Resets: Tomorrow at midnight
```

## 🔧 **Maintenance**

### **Admin Commands**
- **View Limits**: Check `codes.json` for all user daily counts
- **Reset Limits**: Modify `dailyScraping.count` in specific access code
- **Add Users**: New access codes automatically get daily limits initialized

### **Monitoring**
- **Daily Counts**: Track usage patterns per access code
- **Reset Times**: Monitor automatic daily resets
- **Security**: Verify limits cannot be bypassed

## 🎉 **Result**

The new system provides **enterprise-grade security** for daily scraping limits:

- 🔒 **Unbreakable** - No user manipulation possible
- 📈 **Persistent** - Limits survive all session changes  
- 🎯 **Accurate** - Real-time tracking and daily resets
- 🚀 **Scalable** - Works for unlimited users and access codes

**Daily limits are now truly secure and reliable!** 🎯
